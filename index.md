QGreenland-Net is a collaboration between the
[QGreenland](https://qgreenland.org) team and the [NSF Arctic Data
Center](http://arctic.icecoredata.org/). QGreenland-Net seeks to develop an
ADC-maintained Open Geospatial Data Cloud (OGDC) to improve discoverability,
accessibility, and interoperability for geospatial data from the
[DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/) federation of data repositories. Using these
cloud resources, researchers and educators will be able to identify geospatial
data of interest from the network of repositories, make data transformations,
and then share, analyze, and visualize those data via QGreenland or other
geospatial software.
