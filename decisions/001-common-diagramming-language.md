## Context

Architecture diagrams can be made with a variety of programs that have varying levels of
interoperability.

We'd like to be able to collaborate effectively and efficiently on architecture diagrams.


## Decision

We will use Mermaid to record diagrams on GitHub.

We may still use another tool for live diagramming, e.g. Excalidraw.


## Status

{{< meta status >}}


## Consequences

* We will be able to use Git to collaborate on each-other's diagrams.
* We will make more diagrams because we have more expertise with a diagramming tool.


## Consent
