## Context

It's been difficult for our team to find team where we can all meet. We've been using
When2Meet, but it's still very difficult to find times, resulting in some of us having
to attend at 7AM local time or other downsides.


## Decision

We will establish a monthly one-hour "office hours" meeting. By default, we will not
meet at that time, but we will keep the space clear on our calendars and any team member
can call for using that time to meet as needed.

We will notify the team using the calendar RSVP system when we will be unavailable for
that meeting.


## Status

{{< meta status >}}


## Consequences

* We will be able to meet more reliably.
* We will spend less time scheduling meetings.
