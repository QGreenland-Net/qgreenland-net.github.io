QGreenland-Net is a collaboration between the
[QGreenland](https://qgreenland.org) team and the [NSF Arctic Data
Center](http://arctic.icecoredata.org/). QGreenland-Net seeks to develop an
ADC-maintained Open Geospatial Data Cloud (OGDC) to improve discoverability,
accessibility, and interoperability for geospatial data from the DataONE
federation of data repositories. Using these cloud resources, researchers and
educators will be able to identify geospatial data of interest from the network
of repositories, make data transformations, and then share, analyze, and
visualize those data via QGreenland or other geospatial software.

This repository and its contents are a starting point for this collaborative
work. Technical decisions, notes, architecture diagrams, and other information
shared between the QGreenland team and ADC will be maintained in this space.
