* Has established infrastructure, collaboration patterns, docs, other community
  infrastructure.
* Resources:
    * Docs: <https://pangeo-forge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>
    * Paper: <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2021.782909/full>
    * Talk: Yuvi Panda' Pangeo Forge Tech Spotlight demo
        * TODO: Get accessible link
* Plan to set up a meeting with Aimee B from Pangeo Forge / DevSeed after our Tuesday
  tech/infra/architecture meeting.
    * Aimee said the timing is really good, as they’re starting up major development
      efforts and trying to understand how the project can better serve NASA needs.


### Upcoming technical all-hands meeting

* Prepare for tomorrow’s meeting to make best use of Matt J’s time; only half hour!
* Planning doc: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MnFYpR5pZj09zUsNCoEWibzS2amjMEcfYW9LjgtTQvk/edit#heading=h.sx02wqjuczm3>
* Rushiraj: ”gut check” if these questions are important to ask Matt J, or if someone
  can answer to make a better use of Matt’s 30 minutes.


### Place to put our work
* Set up a repository? Notes, architecture diagrams, decisions, etc. in repo; discussions
  in “Discussions”; ???
- [x] Matt F, Trey: start a new QGreenland-Net org, repo, discussions, etc.
- [x] Give everyone “owner” privileges in the org.
- [x] Transfer today’s meeting notes there
- [ ] Transfer discussions from QGreenland repo -> new org
- [ ] Start discussion threads for longer-running less-urgent architecture discussions. Does
      async work well for Matt J’s limited time?
- [ ] Add high-level diagram to repo and iterate together
- [x] Create decision record space: <https://github.com/QGreenland-Net/qgreenland-net.github.io/pull/2>
    - [x] Decision: Adopted Mermaid
