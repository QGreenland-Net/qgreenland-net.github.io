## Participants

* Matt F
* Rushiraj Nenuji
* Twila Moon


## Discussion

* How do we meet between QGreenland work periods (i.e. Y1Q2)
  * Monthly team office hours hold, use it when we need it.
  * Bi-weekly (frequency TBD?) dev team meeting with Matt F, Trey, Rushiraj, Matt J, a
    PDG representative. To stay updated and give input. QGreenland team optional.
  * Monthly updates given in `#qgreenland-net` Slack channel. If any concerns or
    discussion, we should use the monthly team office hours to discuss!
* Think about how Twila and Alyse can communicate QGreenland portal changes to users
  during the "gap time".
  * RR: Portal is ready to be reviewed by QGreenland team, will share in
    `#qgreenalnd-net` slack channel.
  * The workflow we've build/tested only works on polygons right now, so that's what we
    have in the portal.
  * Twila: Specific feedback, or general check out what it will look like?
    * RR: For the users, does it serve the needed purpose, represent the information in
      an accessible way, how can we improve?
* How do we use the Roadmap feature in our board? Instead of using iterations, using
  start/end date markers? Mismatches with my expectations for Epics right now.

Text of reminder: `:mega: It's time for a monthly project update! Please update the "one page" Google document (TODO: Link) as if it were any other meeting, then announce in Slack when you're done to alert the team.` We then have that week to raise any concerns and trigger an office hours meeting.
