### Instructor-led workshops

In addition to our self-directed training materials, our team provides live, hands-on training in how-to use QGreenland in different contexts. Whether that context is research, data development, or education. Upcoming workshops are listed on the upcoming workshops page, and all materials and information from previous workshops can be found on the past workshops page.
