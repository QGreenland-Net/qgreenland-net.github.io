**Educator Workshop**
July 29-31, 2025
Applications open in late March

Overview: Do you want to engage your students with real-world data and build skills they can use in their careers? Do you want to use and teach GIS in your classroom? QGreenland invites educators to a dedicated workshop to develop learning resources using QGreenland data. The workshop will bring together instructors across disciplines to create and adapt learning resources that use Greenland-focused data. The workshop will include training on how to perform basic analyses in QGIS, research-based pedagogical approaches, and how to find additional data for use with QGreenland. This workshop is best suited for formal undergraduate or graduate educators. Familiarity with QGIS is not required.
