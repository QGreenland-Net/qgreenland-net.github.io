title: "Evaluation: Argo Workflows"
---

## Installation

Argo Workflows installs as a Custom Resource Definition (CRD).


## Submitting jobs

Jobs are submitted to the Kubernetes cluster as Custom Resources.


## Developer experience

The Argo CLI abstracts away much of the pain of submitting and supervising work on a
Kubernetes cluster.

  end

  DEV -->|submit| KUBERNETES
  KUBERNETES -->|status| DEV

  style KUBERNETES fill:#FFFFFF;
```


## Monitoring

Argo Workflows offers a robust user interface for visualizing jobs, their status, their
logs, and accessing output artifacts.


## Maturity

Adopted by Cloud Native Computing Foundation, well-funded, and very mature.


## Community

Very large and very well-managed community.
