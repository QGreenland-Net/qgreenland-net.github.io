## Repository Management

* All new repositories should be created in the [Greenland-Net](https://github.com/QGreenland-Net) github organization. 
* If the repository is exploratory the name should be `repo-exploration`.
* Repositories that are no longer in use should be archived promptly.
* We strive to follow best practices to structure the repository for the given need. For example use the [scientific python guide](https://scientific-python.org/development/).

## Code Contributions

* Strive to create tests for all new features/bugfixes.
* New or modified features should be accompanied by adequate documentation.
* Follow the recommended [git flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow#following-github-flow).

## Code Review

* Create pull requests liberally. Ideally each pull request implements a single feature tracked by an issue on the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/QGreenland-Net/projects/1/views/1).
    * Make sure pulll request is linked to related issue in the description. 
* Add other team members as reviewers on all pull requests. 
    * Ping individual contributors on slack if their review is desired. 
    * Wait for atleast one approval before merging.
