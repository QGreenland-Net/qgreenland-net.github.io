## Why Greenland in 2025?

* Greenland Science Week is every ~2 years. This is year 2 of our 3-year
  project.
* Getting the word out about our project (e.g,. via [informative
  postcards](https://qgreenland.org/sites/default/files/2025-12/QGreenland%20DataONE%20postcards.pdf))
* Opportunity to engage with stakeholders and others involved with Greenland-focused science directly.
* Listening/Learning!

Robyn M., Trey S., Angie G., and Ian N. did a fishing excursion together with

## Key takeaways/Common themes

* [International Polar Year 5 (IPY-5)](https://ipy5.info/) (2032-2033) planning
  is underway. Calls for project endorsements expected in early 2026.
* Concerns about US-based projects and funding ending abruptly. Importance of
  communicating "evergreen" project artifacts.
* Difficulties with science funding are wider than just the U.S..
* ArcGIS StoryMaps are a commonly used tool for science communication.
