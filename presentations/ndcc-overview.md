## Workshop overview

* San Diego, CA March 6-7, 2024
* Focus on defining NSF vision for accessible, cloud-based climate science
* Similarities to [National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Pilot
  (NAIRR)](https://new.nsf.gov/focus-areas/artificial-intelligence/nairr)
* ~30 projects represented
* Mostly PIs in attendance
* Trey represented the QGreenland-Net project

::: {.notes}
Workshop focused on defining a vision for the NSF's activities supporting the
creation of a more integrated cloud-based system for climate science. 

The NDC-C is a 2-year pilot that aims to lay the foundations for an NDC that
will cater to a wider science community.

"The National Science Foundation (NSF) initiated the development of a National
Discovery Cloud for Climate (NDC-C) to “federate advanced compute, data,
software, and networking resources, democratizing access to a
cyberinfrastructure ecosystem that is increasingly necessary to further
climate-related science and engineering”. The NDC-C builds on many existing
efforts supported by the CISE and GEO directorates across the entire science
vertical from hardware to foundational infrastructure to software services to
core climate research to community activities." -

CISE == Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering
GEO == Geosciences Directorate

There were ~30 projects represented, ranging from infrastructure work (e.g., new
HPC resources) to research projects focused on answering earth-science questions
using cloud-computing resources (e.g., permafrost landscape analysis in the
Arctic). Discussions ranged from "grandiose" visions of a cloud-based
computational environment that users interact with through AI natural-language
interfaces to what we can do as a disparate group of individually-funded
projects in the next 6-18 months.

# Collaborations explored

* [EAGER: Scalable Climate Modeling using Message-Passing Recurrent Neural Networks](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2335773)
* [Elements: A workflow for efficient and reproducible permafrost geomorphology analysis](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2311319)
* [Pelican: Advancing the Open Science Data Federation Platform](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2331480)
* [National Data Platform Pilot: Services for Equitable Open Access to Data](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2333609)

::: {.notes}
* "EAGER: Scalable Climate Modeling using Message-Passing Recurrent Neural Networks" project are working on AI models that could be leveraged by QGreenland-Net to suggest/automate the creation of data transformation workflows.
* "Elements: A workflow for efficient and reproducible permafrost geomorphology analysis" project is interested in using the tools we develop to find and extract data of contextual importance to study sites in Greenland
* "Pelican: Advancing the Open Science Data Federation Platform" project and I spoke about potentially adding QGreenland data to the Open Science Data Federation Platform (OSDF), which provides cloud-friendly access to science data via a global network of data caches.
* "National Data Platform Pilot: Services for Equitable Open Access to Data" project spoke with me about the possibility of connecting the ADC/DataOne to the National Data Platform, which provides AI tools to support data discoverability.
