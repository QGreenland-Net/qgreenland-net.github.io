## Workshop overview

* San Diego, CA March 6-7, 2024
* Focus on defining NSF vision for accessible, cloud-based climate science
* Similarities to [National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Pilot
  (NAIRR)](https://new.nsf.gov/focus-areas/artificial-intelligence/nairr)
* ~30 projects represented
* Mostly PIs in attendance
* Trey represented the QGreenland-Net project

Workshop focused on defining a vision for the NSF's activities supporting the creation of a more integrated cloud-based system for climate science

"The National Science Foundation (NSF) initiated the development of a National Discovery Cloud for Climate (NDC-C) to “federate advanced compute, data, software, and networking resources, democratizing access to a cyberinfrastructure ecosystem that is increasingly necessary to further climate-related science and engineering”. The NDC-C builds on many existing efforts supported by the CISE and GEO directorates across the entire science vertical from hardware to foundational infrastructure to software services to core climate research to community activities." - https://www.nationaldiscoverycloud.org/home

CISE == Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering
GEO == Geosciences Directorate

::: {.notes}
* "EAGER: Scalable Climate Modeling using Message-Passing Recurrent Neural Networks" project are working on AI models that could be leveraged by QGreenland-Net to suggest/automate the creation of data transformation workflows.
* "Elements: A workflow for efficient and reproducible permafrost geomorphology analysis" project is interested in using the tools we develop to find and extract data of contextual importance to study sites in Greenland
* "Pelican: Advancing the Open Science Data Federation Platform" project and I spoke about potentially adding QGreenland data to the Open Science Data Federation Platform (OSDF), which provides cloud-friendly access to science data via a global network of data caches.
* "National Data Platform Pilot: Services for Equitable Open Access to Data" project spoke with me about the possibility of connecting the ADC/DataOne to the National Data Platform, which provides AI tools to support data discoverability.
