## Workshop overview

* San Diego, CA March 6-7, 2024
* Focus on defining NSF vision for cloud-based climate science
* Similarities to [National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Pilot
  (NAIRR)](https://new.nsf.gov/focus-areas/artificial-intelligence/nairr)
* ~30 projects represented
* Mostly PIs in attendance
* Trey represented the QGreenland-Net project

::: {.notes}
* "EAGER: Scalable Climate Modeling using Message-Passing Recurrent Neural Networks" project are working on AI models that could be leveraged by QGreenland-Net to suggest/automate the creation of data transformation workflows.
* "Elements: A workflow for efficient and reproducible permafrost geomorphology analysis" project is interested in using the tools we develop to find and extract data of contextual importance to study sites in Greenland
* "Pelican: Advancing the Open Science Data Federation Platform" project and I spoke about potentially adding QGreenland data to the Open Science Data Federation Platform (OSDF), which provides cloud-friendly access to science data via a global network of data caches.
* "National Data Platform Pilot: Services for Equitable Open Access to Data" project spoke with me about the possibility of connecting the ADC/DataOne to the National Data Platform, which provides AI tools to support data discoverability.
