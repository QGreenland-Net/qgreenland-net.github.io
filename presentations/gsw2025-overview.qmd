## Why Greenland in 2025?

* Greenland Science Week is every ~2 years. This is year 2 of our 3-year
  project.
* Getting the word out about our project (e.g,. via [informative
  postcards](https://qgreenland.org/sites/default/files/2025-12/QGreenland%20DataONE%20postcards.pdf))
* Opportunity to engage with stakeholders and others involved with Greenland-focused science directly.
* Listening/Learning!

## QGreenland-Net Team In Greenland

* Trey Stafford and Robyn Marowitz of NSIDC attended as software developers
* Twila Moon of NSIDC attended as PI.
* Angie Garcia of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis
  (NCEAS) attended as a community engagement/outreach coordinator.
* Ian Nesbitt of NCEAS attended as a data repository expert.

## Cryosphere side-meeting Nov. 10

* Held at the Nuuk High School and included students.
* Hands-on component included samples from icebergs and a VR experience.
* Talks included information about Students on Ice (SOI) and research
  being done at GEUS about Ice Marginal Lakes.

## Marine Research Seminar Nov. 11

Topics of talks included:

* Marine food webs and physical/human interactions.
* Upcoming research expeditions.
* Monitoring programs.
* Tourism and cruise ship industry.

::: {.notes}
There was a lot of ground covered in this day, and the topics above are a
sampling.

In addition to talks and discussion, lunch was provided. Lunch was a nice
opportunity to talk with people directly!

TODO: consider more in-depth info?

## Conference Nov. 12-13

* Robyn M. presented a [poster about
  QGreenland-Net](https://qgreenland.org/sites/default/files/2025-12/gsw-poster-2025_small.pdf).
* Ian N. presented [a talk about federated data
  repositories and the QGreenland-Net project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sNAvMQg-hLpiicpnBDeSluxqIJA2EoWz/view)
* Twila M. presented a talk about some of her work with summer schools in
  Greenland.

::: {.notes}
The conference itself was held in the culture center in Nuuk. It was a large
conference (#attendees?) that covered a huge range of topics related to science
in Greenland. There were many people who studied snow/ice, but also ecosystems,
biochemistry, climate modeling, astronomy, etc.

The conference took place over two days. There were two concurrent rooms with
talks - our team attended both to ensure we heard about everything!
:::

## Meeting at Asiaq Nov. 14

Met with stakeholders from Asiaq and GINR to discuss QGreenland-Net activities
and priorities. We also received updates from Asiaq and GINR and talked about
ways we could collaborate moving forward.

:::{.notes}
* Asiaq focuses on towns/settlements. New data updates related to Nuuk and
  Sisimiut expected in early 2026.
* Idea to create a strategy document about DataONE/QGreenland-Net ecosystem and
  how Asiaq could fit into that.
* Updates to NunaGIS and NatureMap

Robyn M., Trey S., Angie G., and Ian N. did a fishing excursion together with
Nuuk Water Taxi on Saturday after GSW. We caught many Arctic Cod and enjoyed a
meal prepared with our catch afterwards!

## Key takeaways/Common themes

* [International Polar Year 5 (IPY-5)](https://ipy5.info/) (2032-2033) planning
  is underway. Calls for project endorsements expected in early 2026.
* Concerns about US-based projects and funding ending abruptly. Importance of
  communicating "evergreen" project artifacts.
* Difficulties with science funding are wider than just the U.S..
* ArcGIS StoryMaps are a commonly used tool for science communication.
