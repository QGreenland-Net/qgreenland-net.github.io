## Why Greenland in 2025?

:::{.light-background}
* Greenland Science Week is every ~2 years. This is year 2 of our 3-year
  project.
  * Events held across Greenland Nov. 7-14.
  * QGreenland-Net team in Nuuk Nov. 9-16.
* Opportunity to engage with collaborators and others involved with Greenland-focused science directly.
* Listening/Learning!
* Getting the word out about our project (e.g,. via [informative
  postcards](https://qgreenland.org/sites/default/files/2025-12/QGreenland%20DataONE%20postcards.pdf))

## GSW Conference Nov. 12-13

:::{.light-background}

::: {.r-fit-text}

![Conference took place in the Katuaq culture center](https://trey-stafford.github.io/images/greenland_science_week_conf.jpg){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
The conference itself was held in the culture center in Nuuk. It was a large
conference (#attendees?) that covered a huge range of topics related to science
in Greenland. There were many people who studied snow/ice, but also ecosystems,
biochemistry, climate modeling, astronomy, etc.

Our team attended both tracks of talks to ensure we heard about everything!
:::


## GSW Conference Nov. 12-13

:::{.light-background}

::: {.r-fit-text}
* Robyn M. presented a [poster about
  QGreenland-Net](https://qgreenland.org/sites/default/files/2025-12/gsw-poster-2025_small.pdf).

  repositories and the QGreenland-Net project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sNAvMQg-hLpiicpnBDeSluxqIJA2EoWz/view)

## Meeting at Asiaq Nov. 14

:::{.light-background}

Met with collaborators from Asiaq and GINR to discuss QGreenland-Net activities
and priorities. We also received updates from Asiaq and GINR and talked about
ways we could collaborate moving forward.

:::

:::{.notes}
* Asiaq focuses on towns/settlements. New data updates related to Nuuk and
  Sisimiut expected in early 2026.
* Idea to create a strategy document about DataONE/QGreenland-Net ecosystem and
  how Asiaq could fit into that.
* Updates to NunaGIS and NatureMap

Robyn M., Trey S., Angie G., and Ian N. did a fishing excursion together with
Nuuk Water Taxi on Saturday after GSW. We caught many Arctic Cod and enjoyed a
meal prepared with our catch afterwards!

## Key takeaways/Common themes

:::{.light-background}

* [International Polar Year 5 (IPY-5)](https://ipy5.info/) (2032-2033) planning
  is underway. Calls for project endorsements expected in early 2026.
* Concerns about US-based projects and funding ending abruptly. Importance of
  communicating "evergreen" project artifacts.
* Difficulties with science funding are wider than just the U.S..
* ArcGIS StoryMaps are a commonly used tool for science communication.

:::


## Thank you!
